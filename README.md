## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This was one of my first times using react outside of Lab 1 so it took me a few tries to connect the different pages properly. I also was still getting used to React features like props and how to pass data through the parameters. I've become comfortable using html and css outside of this course which made formatting something simple easier although I wish I took the time to play around more and implementing a mobile responsive site and making the cards more visually appealing!
